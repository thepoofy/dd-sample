Build Tools:  Build tools: 30.0.2, Android Studio 4.1
Focus Areas:  Application structure and organization.
Copied in Code, of my own writing:
 - LifecyclePresenter, PresenterView
    These are my simple MVP framework that works with Lifecycle and makes applications easier to compose.
 - dependencies.gradle
    Copied in from a side project under active development so I could be sure these were up to date.
 - build.gradle (project)
    `subprojects` block is not of my own design, but makes adding many modules to a project easier.

Focus: designed for a phone
Time spent: 6 1/3 hours
 - 4.5 hours to functional app, then another hour plus to write tests for the presenter.


Notes about application structure:
    The general structure of app and core modules is something I've used repeatedly in projects in the last few months.
This organizes the top of my dependency graph.
The contents of the dependency graph in this project is completely novel to this project.

Most dependencies used to build this project are square products themselves.  What notably isn't: Dagger2, RxJava3, AutoDispose
